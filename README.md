# Doomsday Tracker

> This project is a commodities and exchange rate tracker.


I made this project to create a practical implementation of a redux store using react hooks and to use charting packages for react. The application is frontend only and the idea is that it will track the prices for oil and gold as commidities, and also track the exchange rate for the euro against the dollar. All of this information is then plotted with the intention of giving a picture about how the economy is doing.

## Built With

- React
- Typescript
